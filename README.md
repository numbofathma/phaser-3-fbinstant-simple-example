# Phaser 3 + Facebook Instant Games - Simple working example

None of examples or tutorials on the net were working/clearly writed for me, so i did the easiest possible example without es6 and anything like that. 3 Files of JS, index.html and Phaser/FBInstant libs.

Game includes preloader which can be used to preload assets while FBInstant is loading the game, and the menu scene that, well, doesn't do anything but it exists so applause for it.

You can simply pack all these files to the .zip, and upload at your facebook instant games account to see the result.

Thanks for visiting.
